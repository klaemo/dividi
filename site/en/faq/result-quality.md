title: How good is the division?
order: 6
---

Under the given conditions (class size, number of groups, contact lists) the application calculates a division in which the number of contacts between the groups is kept low. However, note that currently no efficient algorithm is known for an optimal solution to this problem (graph partitioning). Therefore, we cannot give a theoretical guarantee for the quality of our solution. Yet, in practice, our results are almost always very close to the best possible values. For optimal solutions and larger classes, we recommend professional programs like KaHIP.

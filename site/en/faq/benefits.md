Hybrid teaching with split classes is challenging for everyone. Therefore, it is important to choose a sensible division of the class. From a social perspective, this means that as many friendships as possible should be preserved. This promotes acceptance and well-being among students.

From an epidemiological perspective, the number of out-of-school contacts between groups should be kept as small as possible. The idea of the division is to narrow contact networks. It would therefore defeat the purpose, if the students from different groups met again in the afternoon in sports clubs or at home. In the end, the virus would find its way back into both groups.

Network researchers have already investigated the epidemiological effect of split classes in detail, and how much this effect can be further increased by minimizing the contacts between divisions. The greatest effect is always achieved by the division itself. But the more out-of-school contacts are prevented, the more effective the division becomes.

The goal of this application is therefore to help in finding a division that reflects these issues.
